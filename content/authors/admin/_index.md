I am a senior undergraduate at Peking University, major in Information Science.

My mission is to build a bridge between machine learning algorithms and logical reasoning, starting from natural language to design a conceptual system and reasoning method that conforms to human cognition, so as to form a highly generalized and transferable learning system.
